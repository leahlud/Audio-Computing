# lab-1: Forward and Inverse STFT

The purpose of this lab is to familiarize you with taking a sound to the time/frequency domain and back. You will code a spectrogram routine, its inverse, and then run some examples to see the effects of various parameters when performing such analyses. Although you can find existing functions to perform some of these calculations, you will have to develop your own version from scratch. This will allow you to perform some more complex processing later in the semester, and of course it will also give you a deeper understanding of how things work.

You will likely reuse a lot of this code in future labs, so this is not one of the labs to skip!
