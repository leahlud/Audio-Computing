# lab-0: Introduction

In this lab, you will find a series of tasks that will help you get started with audio processing using Python. We will start with learning how to generate test sounds, how to read/write audio files, how to perform simple waveform editing and finally how to use real time audio I/O. Look at the provided hints and try to figure out how to do these tasks on your own. The instructions are intentionally vague so that you practice your problem solving. If you get stuck, talk to me or our TAs for more hints. Make sure that any necessary soundfiles are inside a subdirectory called "data" at the same file location as your notebook.

Have fun!
